# Tabela FIPE Spring Boot Project 🛠️💻

This project is a Spring Boot application that simplifies access to vehicle prices in the FIPE Table directly from the terminal. It offers intuitive and efficient functionalities, such as filtering by vehicle type (truck, car, and motorcycle), filtering by model, and the ability to view all vehicles of a particular model, including information on value, brand, model, model year, and type of fuel.

## Data Source 🌐

This project utilizes the Tabela FIPE API provided by [Parallelum](https://parallelum.com.br/fipe/api/v1/).
